Now I am a Ph.D. Candidate now. As a Ph.D. student, I am obligated to serve as a teaching assistant, a research staff and a student at the same time. Study life in Dartmouth is stressful. Because the quarter terms in Dartmouth, even I only choose one course per term, I still have to get 3 classes every week. My background in CS is poor, so it is really an mission impossible for me to be a good TA in the general CS course. In lab, there is a deadline to meet at Decemberâ€¦ 

The good thing is, I finally have some interesting things to do:) This would probably be the most intelligence-chanllenging term I've ever had!
